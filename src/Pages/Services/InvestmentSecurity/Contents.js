As the underwriter, Dimension assesses risk and the appropriate price of particular securities and ensures that the client’s offering will raise the capital needed. Upon agreement with the issuer, the underwriting can either be done on guaranteed or on best-effort basis.

                                        <br /><br />
                                        We are specialized in the underwriting of securities in the Armenian market, guiding medium and large size local companies through the entire capital raise process. We act as an advisor for our clients, file the prospectus and submit the application to the Central Bank of Armenia on behalf of the issuer. To secure investments, Dimension organizes financial roadshows to market the securities through series of presentations and meetings. Dimension gathers initial non-binding subscriptions and gauges the demand for the securities. When the securities are registered, Dimension closes the offering and sells the securities to investors through an exchange (IPOs, secondary public offerings).

                                        <br /><br />
                                        In some cases, Dimension may involve co-underwriters for the capital raise process, forming an underwriting syndicate.
